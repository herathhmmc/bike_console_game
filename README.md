## Code Explanation üíª

This game is developed in C++ and uses the following libraries:

- `iostream`: The `iostream` library is used for basic input and output operations. It allows the game to display messages and information on the console.

- `conio.h`: The `conio.h` library is used for reading keyboard inputs. It enables the game to respond to key presses and control the bike's movements based on user input.

- `windows.h`: The `windows.h` library is used for console manipulation functions. It helps clear the console screen and provides control over console display.

- `cstdlib`: The `cstdlib` library is used for random number generation. It's used to randomize the position of obstacles and enemies in the game.

- `string` and `cstring`: The `string` and `cstring` libraries are used for string manipulation. They are used to manage player names and display text-based game elements.
