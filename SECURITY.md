## Authentication and Authorization

The "the-bike-game" is a single-player text-based game and does not require user authentication or authorization. There are no user accounts or access control mechanisms in place.

## Input Validation

User inputs, such as keyboard commands (e.g., 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D', 'X'), are limited to predefined values. Input validation is not explicitly required since the game only accepts specific keypresses.

## Data Sanitization

The game does not interact with external databases or user-generated content that could introduce data sanitization concerns. It processes user inputs for gameplay but does not store or transmit sensitive data.

## Error Handling

Error handling in the "the-bike-game" is minimal. The game primarily focuses on gameplay, and any errors are typically handled by closing the game with a game over message. There is no sensitive information to protect, and errors are not logged.

## External Dependencies

The game relies on standard C++ libraries for basic functionalities, including input/output and random number generation. These libraries are part of the standard C++ distribution and are considered reliable.

## Code Review and Testing

The code for "the-bike-game" has not undergone formal security testing. As a text-based game, the focus is on gameplay functionality rather than security. Contributors are encouraged to follow coding best practices.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

As "the-bike-game" is a simple text-based game, it does not have a dedicated security team or formal vulnerability reporting process. Users are encouraged to use best practices for responsible disclosure if they discover vulnerabilities.
